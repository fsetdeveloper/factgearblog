**What the heck?!**  
Yep, that’s exactly where I’m at right now.

I know, I know. I’m on the clock, getting paid to work the usual office hours, and when my business sponsor, my boss, or any of my coworkers ask for something, it’s my job to deliver. Write code, document stuff, brainstorm, go to meetings, and yes, do whatever it takes to keep things moving.

But lately… things have gotten *weird*.

First, there’s this strange request for something that doesn’t even exist yet. No validation, no clear outcome, nothing concrete to work with. Just a vague demand for something to be done—yesterday.

Here's how it went down:  
- **Monday** – They drop the requirement out of nowhere.  
- **Tuesday** – Draft output expected by EOD. Somehow, I manage to pull it together.  
- **Wednesday** – Feedback rolls in. Adjustments due first thing **Thursday morning**.  
- Then? Radio silence… until **3PM Friday**!

*ARGH!*  
This isn’t a job; it’s a test of my sanity. 

The worst part? By the time I finally get an answer, I’m already working on the next “urgent” request, barely catching my breath. It’s like an endless cycle, this special kind of “relationship” with the sponsor. And every week, I wonder, *how long can I keep up with this?*
