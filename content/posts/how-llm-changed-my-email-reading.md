As you my aware by now, I am not native English speaker.  
I wasn’t born in English speaking language country.  

In fact, I was exposed to English Language only when i was around 16 years old!
Better be late than never, right!?  

However, I’m survived till today without having too much issue communicating.
Recently I realized that more and more often I’m relying on Claude and ChatGPT to help me reading some emails.  

I often use prompt like:
 
```
Please read my email and explain in details while using simple words on the intention of the email.  
Provide clarity and reply in points format.

[PUT EMAIL CONTENT HERE]
```   

I can't imagine that I need to use that to read someone who is born in UK, speaking English their whole life.  

What I realized, some people are just not a good communicator.  

Agree?
