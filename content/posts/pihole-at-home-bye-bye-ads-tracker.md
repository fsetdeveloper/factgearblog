I LOVE MY PIHOLE!!!  

![PiHole Stats](/images/pihole.png#center)

I love to do small project at home, I've been looking at the Single Board Compute [SBCs reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCs/).
I could say the poison really works!  

#### Spec üñ•Ô∏è
Finally I pull my wallet out (well credit card) and bought this miniPC:  
Brand: Centerm  
Processor: Intel J1800   
Memory: 4GB   
Disk: 64GB SSD   
Price: SGD 40  

Cheap machine, indeed.

#### 
Slap Alpine Linux, install Pihole with Unbound.   
Changed all my devices DNS configuration at home with the pihole ip address.   
Profit!

I can't believe that my smart TV is pinging his mothership like nobody business. 
Best $40 I ever spend.  

Will write the step-by-step later.
