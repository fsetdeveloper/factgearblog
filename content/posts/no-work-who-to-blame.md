If someone told me, "I have no work, I have nothing on my backlog".  
I'm very pissed!  
I'm working super hard, and always rewarded with more works.  

Who should we blame?  
The bosses? or the individual?  

At one side I believe the boss should ensure a healthy work pace, clear objective, goal for next quarter, etc.  
On the other hand, the boss also will always say, "Why you dont proactive and do something. If you are not working, you are **redundant**!"  

That's madness, isn't it?  

My advise is, it takes two hand to clap.  
Very often the bosses are just dumb (LOL!), they dont quite know what they want.  
Asking them questions, is like tell the them the failure on their side, and they not happy being told. 
So, I suggest to look at what you have done on in previous week/month, and see the opportunity:  
- Add documentation
- Update status update
- Prepare FAQs
- Reach out to your users and as for feedback.

With this on hand, you can start doing something.   
It's better to be busy with something, rather than nothing.

But, I will still look at the bosses, and...  
***TELL ME!!! WHY YOU DONT PLAN YOUR TEAM WELL!?***
