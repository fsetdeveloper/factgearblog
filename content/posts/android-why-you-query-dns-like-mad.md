I made progress with my pihole miniPC box!  

Tailscale is installed and configured for DNS resolver when I'm mobile outside home, it never been better, so much lesser ads and distracting stuff. LOVE IT!  

Instruction on how to setup Tailscale for PiHole is [here](https://tailscale.com/kb/1114/pi-hole), super easy to install!!! 😍  

After 1 week with pihole on tailscale enabled whenever I'm ouside home, I start to curious on how much DNS resolutions is my mobile device doing. 🤔  

Drum roll please.... 🥁   

It's is CRAZY! Crazy lots of DNS requests!  😵‍💫   
TBH, I'm mostly working from home, cause my work allow me 80% WFH.  
But looking at the PiHole Stats, it's unbelieveably real, it's the TOP of the client list.  
EVEN HIGHER THAN MY MAIN PC!!!  

That's just crazy!

So, now I'm wondering actually, what kind of tracking and ads that my mobile phone tried to fetch!?
Even for short time of window of using the device.  

Man... Privacy is expensive. 🤑🤑🤑
