# Brewing Code with My New Moka Pot ☕💻

You know what is sleek, shiny, and it makes the most dangerous stuff? Coffee, I mean.  
Yes, I'm talking about my brand-new moka pot! 😍 
OMG I think this is totally upgrade from my usual instant coffe mix.  
What have I been missing in this life?!?!

My morning is now something I'm looking forward.  
Go to the kitchen, spin, pour, mix, brew, happiness engulf.

## My Coding Sessions 🚀

I think I'm more productive now,
I have better fuel to my engine.
Generate more code, and happiness.

But I still hate my business partners. 

Anyway...
Happy coding and happy brewing! ☕💻
